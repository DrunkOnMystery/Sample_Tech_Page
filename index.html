        <header>The Early Days of Morolith</header>
        <p>	The world of Morolith was once a place of mighty civilizations and powerful gods. For centuries, the many gods of that world walked the plains and forests alongside the mighty civilizations of wizards and warriors that populated the world’s four large continents and the surrounding island masses. Mighty empires, filled with powerful mages and wondrous technological achievements sprouted all over the world. Life in that lost age was one of unspeakable wealth and comfort.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="The_Great_Exile">
        <header>The Great Exile</header>
        <p>	But nothing lasts forever, and eventually both the civilizations and the gods themselves fell to in-fighting. Entire cities and kingdoms fell to dust, as the fighting spread across the world. Gods fought each other, and made mortals into their champions, shaping them into tools of their wills. When finally, the dozens of gods had laid waste to entire continents, and gods themselves had begun to be killed by their brethren, that the remaining gods, realizing the potential destruction of the whole of Morolith was imminent, agreed to a plan you know of now as “The Exile”. </p>
        <p>The few gods whose power had not been greatly diminished by the constant fighting opened the veil between this world and the next, and forced every god they could through it, closing it behind them. Only a few gods, desperately weakened by the fighting, remained in Morolith, and in their weakened states, they could not defend themselves, even from the mortals that remained, and were forced to hide in fear. And once the other gods crossed the veil, they could no longer directly intervene in the lives of the mortals of Morolith. Instead, they could only lend their aid and boons indirectly and magically to those they chose.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="The_Dark_Age">
        <header>The Dark Age</header>
        <p>In the centuries after the Exile, the great kingdoms of Morolith all collapsed. Where gods had fallen in death, the lands themselves were permanently altered: fertile farmlands became desolate wastelands and vice versa, seemingly overnight. Men fought over changed landscapes and dwindling resources. Over the next 500 years, the population of Morolith declined by nearly 90%. Kingdoms rose and fell on every continent constantly.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="The_Rise_of_Valbaan">
        <header>The Rise of Valbaan</header>
        <p>But slowly but surely, the races recovered, and new kingdoms, these far longer lasting, began to arise. On the western continent of Lisanthus, one such kingdom was the kingdom of Valbaan. Led by its king, Valbus I, often known as Valbus the Wise or Valbus the Just, the Kingdom of Valbaan rose from its status as a small kingdom in the Eastern plains to be an empire larger than any other kingdom on Lisanthus.</p>
        <p>For more than three centuries, the kings and queens of Valbaan ruled an ever-expanding kingdom, and its many innovations, discoveries, and cultural advancements and reforms were influential, spreading far and wide throughout Lisanthus. For many years, it could be safely said that Valbaan was the envy of all of Lisanthus, if not all the world.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="The_Death_of_King_Jandar">
        <header>The Death of King Jandar</header>
        <p>But in the year 847 AE, disaster struck Valbaan: a plague struck the capital city, and it claimed the lives of many men, women, and children. And chief among the dead was the young King Jandar II, the last direct descendent of the line of Valbus I. With the king dead, and with him having no heir, the throne fell to a distant cousin of Jandar’s named Mychel, a fool who fancied himself wise and a coward who fancied himself brave.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="The_Rise_of_the_Twelve_Sages">
        <header>The Rise of the Twelve Sages</header>
        <p>Quickly, a group of advisers and nobles within the king’s court, referred to, mostly sarcastically, by the citizenry as “the Twelve Sages”, had taken full control of the capital and government, manipulating King Mychel to their advantage, all the while allowing the foolish king to indulge his every whim while his court seized wealth and power for themselves, ignoring the citizenry throughout the kingdom all the while. Neighboring kingdoms began incursions across the border, claiming Valbaanese territory for themselves. The borders of Valbaan began shrinking, monster raids became a far more frequent problem, the workers and armies of the kingdom were often paid late if they were paid at all, and discontent mounted amongst the population across the kingdom, with only the provincial governments serving as any kind of aid for the set-upon citizenry.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="The_Rebellion_of_the_Beranthians">
        <header>The Rebellion of the Beranthians</header>
        <p>Finally, in the year 861 AE, a full-scale rebellion, led by Zuran, the leader of a new cult worshipping the ancient, exiled god Beranthus, broke out in the northern provinces, attracting thousands to its cause. The “unfaithful” were slaughtered, towns were destroyed, and thousands of refugees were sent fleeing South for their lives. The Royal Army, poorly led, underpaid, and given frequently confused and contradictory orders, was scattered before the Beranthians when they clashed at the Battle of Melitas River in 862 AE, and, with the Royal Army seemingly outmatched and no aid coming, many more still joined Zuran’s cause. </p>
        <p>Fearing the capital itself might eventually be overrun, the king and the Twelve Sages sent out a call asking every provincial governor, lord, and bannerman of the king to raise soldiers and march them to the capital to create a singular Grand Army to put down the rebellion. Though there was some resistance from various lords and governors, soon the Grand Army was formed and, after a series of smaller battles throughout the kingdom of Valbaan, they finally defeated the Beranthian Rebellion once and for all at the Battle of the Red Mountain in 864 AE.</p>
        <p>Their victory in hand, the Twelve Sages and the King dispersed the Grand Army and sent the respective leaders they had called back to their territories. But foolishly, neither the Sages nor the King realized that these men had each seen with their own eyes the fecklessness and weakness of the Royal Court, and as each man and woman went back to their home territories, each began to wonder if the Royal Court could continue as it was, and many began to plot their own ascension to power. Provincial governors and lords formed private armies, and began invading each other’s territories. Provinces were consolidated and subjugated by men who sought power by bloodshed and violence. Others sought power via assassination and betrayal. But others still planned their rise to power via the power of the common people themselves. </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="The_Rise_of_Corazon_Rein">
        <header>The Rise of Corazon Rein</header>
        <p>One such man was Corazon Rein, the 17 year old governor of the Yousa Province in the Northwest. When the call to arms had gone out, Corazon had gone at age 15 with his father Lucien, who was the governor at the time, to serve and fight for his kingdom. After his father was wounded in battle during a skirmish in the leadup to the Battle of the Red Mountain, the 17 year old took command of his father’s troops, and while young, proved himself an shrewd leader, a skilled fighter, and a capable battlefield commander. As a thank you for his valor in battle and as consolation after his father succumbed to his wounds shortly after the rebellion ended, the Sages awarded him his father’s old title, but almost as soon as he’d arrived back in Yousa, he found his provincial home invaded by three of its provincial neighbors, Askod, Rakiche, and Gsedia, believing that the young governor would not be able to defeat their combined forces, and that they could partition Yousa into their own territories after his defeat.</p>
        <p>But Corazon was not so easily defeated and, with the help of his most trusted advisor and friend, a half-elf named Theren, the armies of Yousa managed to use their knowledge of the geography of the land to isolate the three invading provincial armies and rout the invading armies in detail, with the Yousan armies ultimately claiming territory from each of the invading provinces as a result. </p>
        <p>The immediate threat removed, Corazon began a quest to ingratiate himself to the people of the Yousa Province. The people and towns throughout the Yousa province came to know Governor Rein as an attentive and approachable leader. When problems arose, he sent help to solve them. When problems grew large enough, he would attend to them personally. </p>
        <p>In time, his renown spread past the borders of Yousa, and, tired of the inaction and inattention of their own regional governors, some towns in other provinces began to send requests for aid to Yousa in hopes that Governor Rein might send aid, and knowing the potential power of the loyalty of the people, Corazon and Theren were always quick to provide aid whenever they could.</p>

        <header>Where Your Story Begins</header>
        <p>And so when a request from the town of Silverbeak in the neighboring province of Askod arrived at the now 19 year old Governor’s doorstep, telling a story of wrecked caravans, attacks on the town, buildings burned, and strange sightings in the neighboring woods, emissaries of the governor sent out a call for adventurers to come to their aid, led by a minister of Rein’s named Loring Raik. You were the ones who answered it. This is how your tale begins.
